    "# Welcome to a [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are an open-source standard for creating what the authors describe as [literate computing](http://blog.fperez.org/2013/04/literate-computing-and-computational.html), a concept derived from Donald Knuth's [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a vigorous debate about what is [good](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyter-receives-the-acm-software-system-award-d433b0dfe3a2) and [bad](https://conferences.oreilly.com/jupyter/jup-ny/public/schedule/detail/68282) about notebooks. Most of the negative critiques stem from issues of software engineering, but as a means of *communicating* compuation, Jupyter notebooks have become very prevalent and liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the perspective of this class, Jupyter notebooks provide a (relatively) easy way for us to explore computation: all you need is a web browser (and a [GitHub](https://github.com/)  account).\n",
    "\n",
    "Notebooks are made up of **cells** and there are three (kind of) types of cells.\n",
    "1. Markdown cells. This is a markdown cell. Markdown cells are great for using language and media to instruct and explain. Markdown is a kind of markup language that allows us to format text (e.g. bold, emphasis, hyperlinks, lists, etc.)\n",
    "2. Code cells. Code cells allow us to write and execute code. For the DeCART classes this will be code written in Python (the language from which Juptyer grew), but Juptyer supports many programming languages. You can see a list of supported languages [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).\n",
    "3. Output cells. Program cells produce output, which for the sake of simplicity I'm going to describe as being a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Markdown cell, a Python code cell, and an output cell are shown below."
